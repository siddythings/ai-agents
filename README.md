# AI Agents Repository

This repository contains a collection of AI agents designed to automate various tasks using different AI models and techniques. The project aims to explore and implement various AI automation solutions that can be used independently or in combination.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository serves as a hub for multiple AI agents, each designed to handle specific automation tasks. The agents leverage different AI models and techniques to provide intelligent automation solutions.

### Current Components

- **DeepSeek RAG Agent**: An agent implementing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using the DeepSeek model for enhanced question answering and information retrieval.

### Planned Components

More AI agents will be added to this repository, each focusing on different automation tasks and use cases.

## 🤖 Available Agents

### DeepSeek RAG Agent

The DeepSeek RAG agent implements Retrieval Augmented Generation, combining the power of language models with external knowledge retrieval. This agent is particularly useful for:
- Question answering with up-to-date information
- Document analysis and summarization
- Knowledge retrieval and synthesis

[More details about usage and configuration will be added]

## 🔄 Future Development

This repository is actively being developed. Planned additions include:
- [Additional agents will be listed as they are planned/developed]
- Integration capabilities between different agents
- Common utilities and shared components
- Documentation and examples for each agent
